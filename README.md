General requirements:
You need to deploy https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic app to the kubernetes cluster. This app should be exposed to the world via ingress. You need to fork this repository and add build and deploy build pipelines for jenkins 

Terraform requirements:
•	Split your infrastructure pieces semantically into modules
•	DRY
•	Remote storage for state file
•	It is allowed to use existing terraform modules
•	All the secrets are stored into SSM parameters or secretsmanager (you don’t provide any secrets directly to terraform; you either discover them at ssm or secretsmanager, or generate them on the fly and then store them at ssm or secretsmanager) *

VPC requirements:
•	Do not use default VPC 
•	Public and private subnets (consider https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html instead of nat gateway to save some costs)
•	Bastion host *
•	Security groups with least privileges possible *
•	NACLs with least privileges possible *

Kubernetes requirements:
•	Automation deployment of the cluster via terraform
•	Control plane and data plane are spread between at least 3 availability zones
•	Cluster deployed in a single region
•	Cluster autoscaling *
•	Do not accept plain http requests, use only https *

Jenkins requirements:
•	100% of configuration is a code, no exceptions (consider https://www.jenkins.io/projects/jcasc/ plugin)
•	Jenkins builds new image on each push and pushes it to any container registry
•	Jenkins deploys new version of the application
•	Jenkins slaves are Kubernetes pods *
•	CI/CD pipelines are triggered via github webhook (must be provisioned with terraform) *
•	Install Jenkins via terraform *

Application requirements:
•	Extract data layer into the RDS (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic#database-configuration) *
